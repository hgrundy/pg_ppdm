PG_PPDM39
---------

These files were converted from the Professional Petroleum Data Management ([PPDM]) Association's Oracle DDL. It seems to work on PostgreSQL 9.3.5, but there has not (yet) been any extensive testing.

Here is some scary legal stuff from PPDM that you should probably read:


> WARNING

#####This is a work in progress and probably has lots of bugs.
